      <description>Hello! My name&amp;rsquo;s Erik Peralta Løvaas, and I&amp;rsquo;m a programmer and Computer Science student at the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU).
I am passionate about writing clean and efficient code that solves challenging, real-world problems. So far, writing back-ends in Java and Python and simple front-ends using JAMstack technology has served me well, but I am looking forward to learning new technologies and broaden my horizons.
Furthermore, I also have experience using web technologies, using and managing Unix-like systems, and doing your typical DevOps work.</description>

      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>
