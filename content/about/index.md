Hello! My name's Erik Peralta LÃ¸vaas, and I'm a programmer and Computer Science student at the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology (NTNU). 

I am passionate about writing clean and efficient code that solves challenging, real-world problems. So far, writing back-ends in Java and Python and simple front-ends using JAMstack technology has served me well, but I am looking forward to learning new technologies and broaden my horizons.

Furthermore, I also have experience using web technologies, using and managing Unix-like systems, and doing your typical DevOps work. 

Currently, my interests lie within Algorithms, Distributed Systems, Security and Technology for Social Good. I am also looking forward to studying Human-Machine Interactions, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Ethics.

Right now, I'm working on an app that combines audio fingerprinting and image analysis to create personalized artwork. More details TBA.

My favorite pastimes outside of technology include music, cinema, writing and spending time outdoors.

I am currently available for both part-time and full-time engagements, depending on whether they collide with my acacemic calendar. Don't hesitate to contact me at erikpl (at) protonmail (dot) com for any serious proposals and/or questions.
